# AboutMe
Introduction

👋 Hi, I’m Shaun
👀 I’m interested in Video games, cycling, working out and of course...Web Development!!! (specifically frontend)
🌱 I’m currently learning Javscript. I have HTML and CSS pretty much down, and I'm now improving my knowledge and skills with JS before moving onto REACT.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that interest me and I believe I can provide a meaningful contribution to.
📫 You can reach me by email: ShaunThompson.webdev@gmail.com
